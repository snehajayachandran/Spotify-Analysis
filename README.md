🎧 Spotify Dashboard Project — Tableau + R 

This repository contains the Spotify Data Analysis Dashboard developed for Assignment 2.
The project involves data cleaning and preprocessing in R, followed by dashboard creation in Tableau.
The dashboard provides interactive insights into track popularity, audio features, and artist/genre patterns.

📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to transform raw Spotify data into meaningful insights using a combination of:

R for data preparation

Tableau for visual analytics

Presentation slides for final reporting

The analysis covers:

Popularity trends

Audio feature distributions (energy, danceability, tempo, etc.)

Top artists and tracks

Genre-level comparisons

Yearly release and listening patterns

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (R)

The raw dataset was cleaned and transformed using R:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Normalising numerical features

Feature extraction

Creating a clean dataset ready for Tableau

(You can upload your R script later — I can help format that section too.)
